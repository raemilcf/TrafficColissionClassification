### Traffic Collision Fatality Classification Analysis
This project is part of the work completed during my first term in the AI & ML program at Lambton College. The focus is on performing a classification analysis on the Traffic Collision Fatality dataset.

#### Overview
The Traffic Collision Fatality dataset contains information about traffic accidents, including various factors that may influence the severity of the collision. The primary goal is to predict whether a traffic collision will result in a fatality based on these factors.

#### Objectives
Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
Build and evaluate classification models to predict the likelihood of a fatal collision.
Interpret the results and identify key factors influencing collision outcomes.

The primary task is to predict whether a traffic collision will result in a fatality (Fatal: Yes/No) using the available features. This involves:

#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling and normalizing data.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
- Identifying potential correlations between features.

#### Model Building:
- Implementing various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

#### Model Evaluation:
- Using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
- Comparing different models and selecting the best-performing one.

#### Interpretation and Insights:
- Analyzing feature importances.
- Drawing conclusions about the key factors affecting collision outcomes.

#### Tools and Libraries
- Python: The primary programming language used.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing classification models and evaluation metrics.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
